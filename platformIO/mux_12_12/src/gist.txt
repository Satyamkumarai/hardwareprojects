* We turn To Ignorance to avoid facing the Truth.
But you know that is not the answer
The Truth will not change , Just because you ignore it.
You have to face the Truth!  You have to face the fear !

Be
truthful about your emotions 
and use your mind and emotions in
your favor, not against yourself

Most people do not know that it’s their emotions that are doing the thinking.
Your emotions are your emotions, but you have got to learn
to do your own thinking.

* “I want to teach you to master the power of money, instead of
being afraid of it"     -> Being afraid of it  ?  
                        -> Master the power of Money ?

Problems:
    Environment : 
        consists of :
            * people
            * Opportunities to work  (I don't have something (real and big) to work on.)

    

Develop Your Environment:


(I don't have something (real) to work on )
    * Start small
        - Where ? 
    * Look out for Opportunities that give a Big chance 

Example of Iresh..
    Got to work in so many things. I think because had 
        - Loves web dev.
        - Got in touch with them (Pranav , Veer , Dharitri )
        - 


Things  I believe:
I believe that when I get an Opportunity to work on something big/Small/New I will do it.

Things I Think is the Problem:
    * Don't Know where to start.
    * 

(
    Had "Contacts" From Early on. 
    Made good and hardworking and knowledgable Friends. 
    Was Outgoing. 
    Had the facility to travel anywhere ?
    Living in Mysore Made it easier to Interact with people and THus making  more friends.
    Which Led to more Opportunities and that led to recognition leading to more Opportunities.
    So it's Like a feedback Loop.

    (*)=> People  => Opportunities => Recognition  =>(*)
)

Things I would advise a person:
    Learn From the knowledgable/Smart people around you.
        - Why ?
            - They would have learnt to face their Failures.
            - Are aware of certain things that you are not yet aware of. (Don't Worry You can learn that too.)
            
    You will Have doubts on Yourself But know that you are better than you currently think you are.
        - Why do we doubt ourselves ?
            - Failure.
            - Others' Success.
            - Lack of Opportunity to prove one's Abilities.
            - Start to doubt if one has that abilities.
            - Feeling That one's work is worthless.
    Have Patience.
    Persevere : Never Give Up.


What  I feel About things:
    - Failure helps You learn : Yes  You must be brave enough to accept and analyze it , Learn from it .
